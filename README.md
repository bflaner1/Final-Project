 GIT 215 Final Project

## Assignment Details

---

**Overview**

*The final project is your time to show off what you have **learned in this class**. This assignment instructions are broken into 6 parts:*

1. Home Page Requirements
2. Contact Page Requirements, *including a wireframe*
3. HTML Requirements for both pages
4. CSS Requirements
5. Testing Requirements
6. Submission Requirements

---

### 1. Home Page Requirements

You will find **home-page-option-1** and **home-page-option-2**.

Each option contains a wireframe and images. You are to **choose one option** that you prefer as a starting point for your index.html page. Match the placement of the content to the wireframe, but style it however you'd like. All colors, fonts, sizes, padding, margins, backgrounds, etc. are ultimately up to you! Be creative.

The images have already been cropped for each option. One set of images are square and one set of images are rectangular. All you will have to do is adjust the width and height of the images in your CSS to fit your web page design. To ensure your images don't get skewed, it is recommended that you define a width, and let the browser automatically calculate the height.

    .some-image {
        width: 300px;
        height: auto;
    }

#### CONTENT - index.html

Below is the content you are required to include on your home page (index.html). *Note:* This is not an all-inclusive list of all the HTML tags you will need. You will need to add classes, ids, sections, etc. in order to code and style this content semantically. **No divs except for those used exclusively for styling, like the grid container in module 6. It is not acceptable to use a div because you don't know how else to make an inline element into a block element or because you aren't sure which semantic container to use. If you're stuck, reach out!**

### 2. Contact Page Requirements

It's your turn to create a wireframe to show how you are going to organize the content of the Contact Page. Only ***hand drawn wireframes*** are accepted so you can spend more time in your code, and less time learning a design program! Your hand drawn wireframe can be detailed or not detailed (with HTML tags or without HTML tags)--it's your preference.

Snap a picture once you are done and upload it to the assignment link. While the quality of the wireframe and image does not have to be perfect, it ***should be as good as you can make it*** as if you are presenting this to your client!

*Note:* Keep the placement of your header, navigation, and footer consistent with your home page. Just focus on what you want the rest of the contact page to look like.

#### CONTENT - contact.html

Below is the content you are **required** to include on your Contact page (contact.html).

*Note:* This is not an all-inclusive list of all the HTML tags you will need. You will need to add classes, ids, sections, etc. in order to code and style this content semantically.

***Header:***<br />
**h1:** Wok Asian Cuisine

***Navigation:***<br />
**nav items:** Home, Our Menu, Order Now, Contact Us *(use placeholder links for the pages you aren't coding.)*

***Main:***<br />
**h2:** Contact Us<br />
**paragraph:** Do you have dietary concerns? Questions about an upcoming event? Drop us a line, and we'll get back to you soon!<br />
**image:** Choose the appropriate image from the contact page folder.

***Form:***<br />
A contact form is required on your Contact page. Use [https://wp.zybooks.com/form-viewer.php](https://wp.zybooks.com/form-viewer.php) for the action attribute, and POST for the method attribute.

The contact form must include the following fields:
- Name* ***Required***

- Zip
- Phone* ***Required***

- Compare the two, preferably side-to-side in your monitor window. Are there any differences? Comment on whether or not you see any differences, what they are, whether it be color, fonts, rounded corners if used, etc. Save as a PDF named lastname_testing (i.e. breaux_testing.pdf)
